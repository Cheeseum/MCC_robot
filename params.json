Sounds good. Just navigate to the github page and click 'clone or download'.\r\n\r\n### I wanna modify the files.\r\nOkay. Let's say you made some good changes. Just fork the repo on the github page. Then make your changes and submit a pull request. Then the pull request will be merged with the main repo. \r\n\r\n### Is using github necessary to contribute?\r\nNo. This is just an easy way to keep track of changes and manage files. Plus, some exposure to github and git is not a bad thing. \r\n",
